======================================

For this assignment, for graphs were replicated and 4 PNG files were produced. The code for each of these is in the respected files plot1.r, plot2.r, plot3.r, plot4.r.

In order to run the code, the data needs to be downloaded from:

- https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

Note:

- The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).
- We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.
- You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the strptime() and as.Date() functions.
- Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as ?.
- The data shows measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
